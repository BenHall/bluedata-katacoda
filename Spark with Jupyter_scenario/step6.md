Step 6 - Checking the Bin File For Spark.

Let's see what you built.
The newly built application package (or bundle) is saved in the deliverables directory. 

<br><br>`cd deliverables`{{execute}}
<br>`ls `{{execute}}

Now you can copy the BIN file to your controller <PROVIDE PATH HERE>. You can now log into your GUI, navigate to the catalog, refresh, and you will see the newly created image available for you to install.
