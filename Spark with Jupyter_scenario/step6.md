Checking the Bin File For Spark.

Let's see what you built.
The newly built application package (or bundle) is saved in the deliverables directory. 
<br>`cd deliverables`{{execute}}
<br>`ls `{{execute}}

Now you can copy the BIN file to your controller <PROVIDE PATH HERE>. You can now log into your GUI, navigate to the catalog, refresh, and you will see the newly created image available for you to install.

To make the new image appear in App Store.
Copy the bin file to /srv/bluedata/catalog using the following commad
cp bin pa

Make it executable using the below command
chmod +x bin

Go to App Store in the EPIC GUI and click on Refresh button to bring the image in to App Store
