Let's see what you built.

Task 1 
Exit out of the workbench shell
<br><br>`exit`{{execute}}

Task 2
The newly built application package (or bundle) is saved in the deliverables directory.
<br><br>`cd deliverables`{{execute}}
<br>`ls `{{execute}}

Now you can copy the BIN file to your controller <PROVIDE PATH HERE>. You can now log into your GUI, navigate to the catalog, refresh, and you will see the newly created image available for you to install.
