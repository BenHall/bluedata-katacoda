Add a logo to your BIN file

We already have a .png file in the ~/test directory. We will copy that file into the Mysql directory by using following command:<br>
`cp ~/test/Logo_mysql.png ~/Mysql`{{execute}}

Logo.png file includes a logo file (400px x 200px .png) to visually identify each application in the App Store
